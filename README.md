# KIMEP Mobile Clients

Unofficial clients for **KIMEP University**'s student portal. The Android app is here
today; an updated iOS client is planned in the same repository.

The apps talk to the university's **old mobile user-facing APIs** — the same ones the
deprecated store app used — and reproduce the useful parts (schedule, grades, academic
calendar) with a native interface, offline caching and class reminders.

## Features

- **Login** with Student ID and password; the session is stored on device and refreshed
  automatically.
- **Schedule** — weekly timetable grouped by weekday, with the **current day highlighted**,
  a **midterm‑week banner** derived from the academic calendar, and pull‑to‑refresh.
  Cached locally so it renders instantly on launch and updates in the background
  (stale‑while‑revalidate).
- **Finals** — a Classes/Finals switch for the exam timetable (populated once the
  university publishes it).
- **Grades** — cumulative GPA and credits, current‑term assessment scores, and the full
  transcript grouped by semester with colour‑coded grade badges.
- **Academic calendar** — the official PDF parsed into structured data: browse both
  academic years and all semesters, with the ongoing event marked **Now**, the next one
  **Next**, and past events dimmed. Opens scrolled to the current event.
- **Reminders** — notifications **1 hour** and **10 minutes** before each class, plus a
  final‑exam reminder. Each is individually togglable.
- **Anonymous analytics** — usage events (screens, taps, retention) sent to a Umami
  instance. On by default with a one‑tap opt‑out in Settings; no personal data, no real
  URLs. See **[docs/ANALYTICS.md](docs/ANALYTICS.md)**.
- **Material You** dynamic colour, light/dark theme, edge‑to‑edge.

```

The download page is deployed by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`, which snapshots the latest
releases into `releases.json` at deploy time and publishes `app-website/` to GitHub Pages.
An `ios/` client is planned; the repository name reflects that.

## Building (Android)

```bash
cd kimep-android
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug        # debug APK
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease      # release APK
```

Requires JDK 17+ and an Android SDK with API 37 (`local.properties` → `sdk.dir`, or the
`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable).

Release builds are signed from `kimep-android/keystore.properties` (git‑ignored):

```properties
storeFile=keystore/kimep-release.jks
storePassword=…
keyAlias=…
keyPassword=…
```

If that file is missing, the release build falls back to the debug signing config so a
fresh clone still compiles.

## Releases & CI/CD

`.github/workflows/android.yml` runs on pushes to `main`, pull requests,
`workflow_dispatch`, and `v*` tags:

1. Sets up JDK 21 and the Android SDK (`platforms;android-37.0`, `build-tools;36.0.0`).
2. Decodes the release keystore from repository secrets into `keystore.properties`.
3. Builds debug and release, **verifies the release signature**, and uploads both APKs as
   build artifacts.
4. On a `v*` tag, publishes a GitHub release with the signed APK. Tags containing
   `beta` / `alpha` / `rc` are marked as pre-releases.

Required repository secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | base64 of `kimep-release.jks` |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | keystore password |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | key alias |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | key password |

If the secrets are absent (for example on a fork), signing is skipped and the release
build falls back to debug signing instead of failing.

To cut a release, bump `versionCode`/`versionName` in
`kimep-android/app/build.gradle.kts`, then push a tag. Full steps:
**[docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md)**.

## How the API was reverse engineered

The iOS app was captured on a stock (non‑jailbroken) iPhone: mitmproxy for the proxy
phase, then a **DNS redirect + reverse proxy** once the Flutter client turned out to
ignore the iOS system proxy. The full, reproducible procedure — including pitfalls and
teardown — is in **[docs/CAPTURE_SETUP.md](docs/CAPTURE_SETUP.md)**.

The resulting endpoint reference is in
**[docs/KIMEP_Mobile_API.md](docs/KIMEP_Mobile_API.md)**.

## Academic calendar pipeline

KIMEP publishes the calendar as PDFs (KAZ/RUS/ENG). `tools/parse_calendar.py` downloads the
English ones and reconstructs the four‑column table from word coordinates
(`pdftotext -bbox`), emitting `calendar.json` that ships as an app asset. Re‑run it each
academic year:

```bash
python3 tools/parse_calendar.py     # needs poppler (pdftotext)
```

## Privacy & analytics

Analytics runs only when a Umami host is configured at build time. When it is, tracking is
**on by default** with a dismissible first‑run notice and a one‑tap opt‑out in
**Settings → Privacy**; turning it off also forgets the random ID.

It collects only anonymous usage events — which screens are opened, which controls are
tapped, and a random on‑device ID used to measure retention. It never collects names,
student IDs, passwords, sessions, grades, courses or any content you view, and it never
sends real URLs. Full details and the event list: **[docs/ANALYTICS.md](docs/ANALYTICS.md)**.

## Built with AI assistance

In the interest of transparency: the current MVP was created with the help of AI —

subscription — alongside manual review and testing on a real device.
